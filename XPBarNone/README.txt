This is a list of the runes you can use to customise XPBarNone.

XP BAR
The default string used to create the XP Bar is:
Exp: [curXP]/[maxXP] ([restPC]) :: [curPC] through level [pLVL] :: [needXP] XP left :: [KTL] kills to level

This would be displayed as something like the following:
Exp: 10000/20000 (15.2%) :: 50.0% through level 27 :: 10000 XP left :: 4 kills to level

The available replacements are:

[curXP]		Current amount of XP.

[KTL]		The amount of kills needed to level. (Can be inaccurate, for example, if you just got 10000 XP for handing a quest in)

Rep: [faction] ([standing]) [curRep]/[maxRep] :: [repPC]
