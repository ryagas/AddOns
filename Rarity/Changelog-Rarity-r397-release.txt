- Rarity will no longer ever try to detect that the tooltip is visible in order to update it when things change. Players will have to hide/show the tooltip to see the changes. This was causing performance issues for a small percentage of players. The tooltip will also never allow updating during combat. (That last change was made in a prior build.)

At level 100, players gain a 25x multiplier to damage done versus MoP bosses; as a result, I believe the following items are very likely to be soloable, so I've preemptively moved them to the solo section:

- Mounts: Clutch of Ji-Kun, Son of Galleon's Saddle, Spawn of Horridon, Reins of the Astral Cloud Serpent, Reins of the Cobalt Primordial Direhorn, Reins of the Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent, Reins of the Thundering Cobalt Cloud Serpent
- Pets: Dark Quivering Blob, Pygmy Direhorn, Quivering Blob, Droplet of Y'Shaarj, Gooey Sha-ling, Kovok

Kor'kron Juggernaut is a Mythic drop, and I'm not sure if it will be soloable at 100, so I've modified its group size to 2.

Added defeat detection for the following pets. Note that Rarity doesn't check that you defeated it on the right difficulty; that's up to you to ensure: Ji-Kun Hatchling, Dark Quivering Blob, Pygmy Direhorn, Quivering Blob, Blackfuse Bombling, Droplet of Y'Shaarj, Gooey Sha-ling, Kovok, Son of Animus

- NPC tooltips now respect the Requires Horde/Alliance flags
- Reins of the Grand Black War Mammoth: Removed the "doNotUpdateToHighestStat" flag; previously, Blizzard had a bug where killing one boss in VoA counted 2 kills on your statistics. This appears to have been fixed at some point. This change will cause players who attempted VoA during Blizzard's bug (Cataclysm-era), to have their attempts jump way up to match their statistics (if they don't already know the mount). Going forward, the attempts should be correct, assuming no further bugs in VoA statistics.

- Toys! Rarity now supports toys. It will check your toy box to see if you already have the item, and will show you the game's source information for where to obtain the toy. 
- World drops (i.e. Super Simian Sphere, Orb of Deception) will not be implemented in Rarity since they can drop from every single thing across multiple continents and instances, and it would be far too disruptive to track them. (Plus they're crazy rare.)
- I'm also not putting Archaeology toys in, as quite a few of them come from Archaeology and it's kind of silly to count an attempt for 10 things every time you complete an archaeology project.
- If I missed a toy that you think is rare, feel free to let me know. Note that all the upcoming 100% drop toys in WoD are already supported. In order to be considered, the toy probably needs to drop from something (with less than 100% drop rate) or come from a container (with less than 100% rate).
- Rarity has the tech necessary to support the pickpocketed dice toys, but I don't have a full list of NPC IDs that can drop those items, so they are not implemented yet.
- The following toys were added with this build: The Heartbreaker, Moonfang Shroud, Moonfang's Paw, Orb of the Sin'dorei, Time-Lost Figurine, Frenzyheart Brew, Unusual Compass, Ai-Li's Skymirror, Blackflame Daggers, Chalice of Secrets, Eternal Kiln, Farwater Conch, Gastropod Shell, Hozen Beach Ball, Kang's Bindstone, Mr. Smite's Brass Compass, Odd Polished Stone, Pandaren Firework Launcher, Panflute of Pandaria, Rime of the Time-Lost Mariner, Warning Sign

- Removed the pickpocketed dice items since I've been told the list of NPCs is wrong and WowHead does not have the list. If a rogue wants to help provide a full list of NPCs that can be used to obtain the dice, I can add them back. In the meantime, pickpocketing support now exists and works, so you can add your own items if you want.

- Renamed "Items" to "Toys & Items"
- Renamed "Companions" to "Battle Pets"
