-- Who: Emmaleah
-- Log: Added all treasure (with Item tags), non 100 named mobs (with item tags) and hardened vines/odd boulders. Set Rank for None, if you just want to get your book and ability to buy garrison plans.  2 is most of the quest content 3 includes all the treasure / rare mobs, etc. Added/improved a few notes, Added more R steps ... including one about avoiding Highpass. Removed all garrison building specific parts (since Ludo is making a new guide type that will include that) I left in fishing and Cordana's quest, but they should probably be deleted too.

N Guide begins in Gorgrond|QID|35557|N|This guide begins as you are leaving Frostfire and riding into Gorgrond. If you aren't there, the nearest flight point is Thunder Pass.|
N Treasure|QID|35557|N|The guide mentions almost all of the treasure to be found in the zone if you set it to rank3. Depending on which building you build at your outpost, you will either have a shredder that can cut thru the hardened vines you run across or Beatface will come remove odd boulders to uncover treasure previously hidden. You can loot the treasure someone else's shredder or Beatface uncovers (for about 2 min after they uncover it.) I include both in the guide, since once the item is exposed, anyone can loot it.|
N Bonus Objectives|QID|35557|N|This guide does not include the bonus objectives. Feel free to do them as you come across them, or save them for more gold at level 100. If you are doing this with a group you will notice that some of the outpost building specific quests are for you may be where the other person(s) will have bonus objectives if they built the other outpost type building.|
