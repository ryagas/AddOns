--------------------

Infus:
	- Add tristate "aggro" to threat trigger
	Ticket-number: 243
	- Improve performance of dynamic groups
	Calling expand on a already visible aura called region:EnsureTrays
	and region:DoControlChildren, which is excessive and unnecessary.
	- Fix none sorting in dynamic groups
	Ticket-number: 213
	- Cooldown Progress for Spells: Replace inverse with a tristate option
	The option allows has the options: Show On Cooldown, Show On Not Cooldown,
	and AlwaysShow. This combines nicely with the charges support to for
	example show a icon if we have at least one charge. That is "AlwayShow" +
	charge > 1.
	
	Ticket-number: 170
	- Guard against custom duration functions returning nil
Benjamin Staneck:
	- remove debug print
Infus:
	- Embers: Fix conditions on number of embers to use 0-40 scale
	Instead of 0-4. Upgrade old auras.
	- Guard against custom text functions returning non-strings
	Lua's tostring formats nil as "nil", so special case that.
	Previously returning tables or functions could lead to errors, this
	ensures that we instead show e.g. "table XXXXX", which should hopefully
	point out that the custom text function returns a table.
Benjamin Staneck:
	- pick up updated/reverted libcompress
Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Use LibButtonGlow-1.0 to avoid potential taint from using the template
Infus:
	- Add spellId matching for combat log trigger
	Helps in creating cross-language triggers.
	- Remove whitespace before importing
	- Deleting a aura should stop its animations
Benjamin Staneck:
	- Fix taint while deleting auras
