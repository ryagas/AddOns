In general added a lot of new stuff and improved the way everything works.

Configuration:
New configuration layout has been implemented in preparation to WoD. Now the options are grouped up differently. Take some time to get used to them though.
- Most of the options are now concentrated in Settings group with tabbed groups in that section.
- Media group contains options for Zone and Subzone titles, Mail and Chat Editbox fonts, as well as a neat screen saver option for when you go afk
- Character window options have been moved to the new "Armory" group. The Armory module handles not only the character window but the inspect window as well. If enabled inspect option in the right-click menu will became blue and you will be able to inspect other S&L users.  Please note this is very beta and stuff may be broken at time of 6.0.2 release.
- Panels and Dashboard now houses not only datatext options but background frames as well
- New About/Help group contains various links to the download/bug report locations
- S&L Install isn't included in ElvUI's installation process like before.  It now launches after completing ElvUI's install which reloads the UI.
- Added nameplate options. You are now able to see your threat and a number of people in your group targeting each unit

Auras (Buffs/Debuffs):
- Option to remove the time remaining for buffs/debuffs for a more minimal look (Your welcome Rehok via twitch)

Background Panels:
- Added alpha option to background panels

Character Frame (Armory Mode):
- Fixed taint that was in live version and 6.0

Chat:

- Version Datatext now shows full ElvUI version instead of only 2 digits of minor version number
- Added alpha option to datatext panels

Incompatible addons:
- Updated the Enhanced Incompatible Message so it can be ignored/Disable Enhanced Addon before reporting issues (Do not report conflicts with ElvUI Enhanced Addon, we do not support it as it is out of date)
- No more identical module names with other ElvUI plugins = no more unexpected incompatibilities!
- The following addons are incompatible with Shadow & Light as they provide the same options:

-- Loot Confirm
-- SquareMinimapButtons

Loot:

- Disabled ElvUI's Auto Greed/DE option when our auto loot module is enabled

Minimap:
- Changed Minimap Icons to enable/disable skinning of the icons, and enable/disable the bar if skinning is enabled.
- Added an option to show instance mode with text instead of texture on minimap.
