==WTF we need to do==
Steal Hydra's animation code (STOLEN, now to be implemented ;) )
Do something with switching between to Darth's from Repocc's settings. Everything continues to be so transparent o_O

==What we maybe can do==
Saw an idea about a dot tracker, saw some coding for it will look at it when have time...
Maybe add the ability to select amount of datatexts on each panel ranging from 1-3 slots
adfas
==Testing Git Setup==
Just a test push b/c I reinstalled Win8 another test.
